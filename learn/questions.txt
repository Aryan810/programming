44. A unit or Egyptian fraction is a fraction of the form
1‚àïn, where n is a positive integer. In this exercise, we
will use strong induction to show that a greedy algorithm
can be used to express every rational number p‚àïq with
0 < p‚àïq < 1 as the sum of distinct unit fractions. At each
step of the algorithm, we find the smallest positive integer
n such that 1‚àïn can be added to the sum without exceed-
ing p‚àïq. For example, to express 5‚àï7 we first start the
sum with 1‚àï2. Because 5‚àï7‚àí1‚àï2= 3‚àï14 we add 1‚àï5 to
the sum because 5 is the smallest positive integer k such
that 1‚àïk < 3‚àï14. Because 3‚àï14‚àí1‚àï5= 1‚àï70, the algo-
rithm terminates, showing that 5‚àï7= 1‚àï2 +1‚àï5 +1‚àï70.
Let T(p) be the statement that this algorithm terminates
for all rational numbers p‚àïq with 0 < p‚àïq < 1. We will
prove that the algorithm always terminates by showing
that T(p) holds for all positive integers p.
a) Show that the basis step T(1) holds.
b) Suppose that T(k) holds for positive integers k with
k < p. That is, assume that the algorithm terminates
for all rational numbers k‚àïr, where 1 ‚â§ k < p. Show
that if we start with p‚àïq and the fraction 1‚àïn is se-
lected in the first step of the algorithm, then p‚àïq =
p‚Ä≤‚àïq‚Ä≤ +1‚àïn, where p‚Ä≤ = np‚àíq and q‚Ä≤ = nq. After
considering the case where p‚àïq = 1‚àïn, use the induc-
tive hypothesis to show that the greedy algorithm ter-
minates when it begins with p‚Ä≤‚àïq‚Ä≤ and complete the
inductive step.
